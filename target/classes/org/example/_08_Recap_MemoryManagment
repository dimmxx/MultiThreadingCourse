Memory Management

There are processes and threads (light-weight processes)

The typical difference is that threads (of the same process) run in a shared
memory space, while processes run in separate memory spaces


            STACK MEMORY                                                   HEAP MEMORY

   the local variables and method                         objects are stored on the heap memory
  arguments as well as method calls                        and live as long as it is referenced from
       are stored on the stack                                 somewhere in the application.

                    EVERY THREAD HAS ITS OWN STACK MEMORY BUT ALL THREADS
                         SHARE THE HEAP MEMORY (SHARED MEMORY SPACE)

The main purpose of synchronization is the sharing of resources without interference
using mutual exclusion.
