==== Deadlock ====

Deadlock occurs when two or more threads wait forever for a lock or resource held by another of the threads
- deadlock is a situation in which two or more competing actions are each
waiting for the other to finish, and thus neither ever does

1) Deadlock in databases:
Deadlock happens when two processes each within its own transaction updates two rows of information but in the opposite order.
For example: process A updates row 1 then row 2 in the exact timeframe that process B updates row 2 then row 1;

2) Deadlock in operating systems:
Deadlock is a situation which occurs when a process or thread enters a waiting state because a resource requested
is being held by another waiting process, which in turn is waiting for another resource held by another waiting process;

==== Livelock ====

- a thread often acts in response to the action of another thread

- if the other thread's action is also a response to the action of another thread
then livelock may occure

- livelocked threads are unable to make further progress. However, the threads
are not blocked: they are simply too busy responding to each other to
resume work

- like two people attempting to pass each other in a narrow corridor: A moves to
his left to let B pass, while B moves to his right to let A pass. They are still
blocking each other, A moves to his right, while B moves to his left ... still not
good

=== How to handle Dead Lock and Live Lock ====

1) we should make sure that a thread does not block infinitely if it is
unable to acquire a lock
- this is why using Lock interface’s tryLock() method is extremely convenient and useful

2) we should make sure that each thread acquires the locks in the same order
to avoid any cyclic dependency in lock acquisition

3) livelock can be handled with the methods above and some randomness
- threads retry acquiring the locks at random intervals
