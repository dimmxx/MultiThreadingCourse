Locks and Synchronized Blocks

A reentrant lock has the same basic behavior as we have seen for
synchronized blocks (with some extended features):

- we can make a lock fair: prevent thread starvation. Synchronized blocks are unfair by default
- we can check whether the given lock is held or not with reentrant locks
- we can get the list of threads waiting for the given lock with reentrant locks
- synchronized blocks are nicer: we do not need the try-catch-finally block
