Volatile keyword

            |  [Cache] - [Core1] : Thread1
Main memory |
   (RAM)    |
            |  [Cache] - [Core2] : Thread2

Every read of a volatile variable will be read from the RAM so from
the main memory (and not from cache)
- usually variables are cached for performance reasons
- caches are faster. Do not use volatile keyword if not necessary
(it prevents instruction reordering which is a performance boost technique)
