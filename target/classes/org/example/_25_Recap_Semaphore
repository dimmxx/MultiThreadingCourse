Semaphores

- invented by Dijkstra back in 1962;
- semaphores are simple variables (or abstract data types) that are used for controlling access to a common resource;
- it is an important concept in operating systems as well;
- it is a record of how many units of a particular resource are available.
We have to wait until a unit of the resource becomes available again

Counting semaphores: allows an arbitrary resource count
Binary semaphores: semaphores that are restricted to the values 0 and 1

> suppose a library has 10 identical study rooms (it can be used by a single student at a time);
> students must request a study room from the front desk;
> if no rooms are free: students have to wait for rooms to be available again so until someone relinquishes a given study room;
> when a student finished using the room, the student must return to the front desk and indicate that one room has become free;

1) semaphores tracks only how many resources are free - it does not keep track of which of the resources are free
2) the semaphore count may serve as a useful trigger for a number of different actions (web servers)
3) producer-consumer problem can be solved and implemented with the help of semaphores (Dijkstra’s approach)
