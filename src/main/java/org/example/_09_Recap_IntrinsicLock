Intrinsic Lock (Monitor)

- every object in Java has a so-called intrinsic lock

- a thread that needs exclusive and consistent access to an object's fields
has to acquire the object's intrinsic lock before accessing them,
and then release the intrinsic lock when it's done with them

- because of the monitor lock: no 2 threads can execute the same
synchronized method at the same time

- a thread owns the intrinsic lock between the time it has acquired the lock and released the lock

- as long as a thread owns an intrinsic lock no other thread can acquire the same lock.
The other thread will be blocked when it attempts to acquire the lock.

THE PROBLEM IS THAT EVERY OBJECT HAS A SINGLE MONITOR LOCK

- if we have 2 independent synchronized methods then
threads have to wait for each other to release the lock
