Livelock

- a thread often acts in response to the action of another thread

- if the other thread's action is also a response to the action of another thread
then livelock may occure

- livelocked threads are unable to make further progress. However, the threads
are not blocked: they are simply too busy responding to each other to
resume work

- like two people attempting to pass each other in a narrow corridor: A moves to
his left to let B pass, while B moves to his right to let A pass. They are still
blocking each other, A moves to his right, while B moves to his left ... still not
good

How to handle Dead Lock and Live Lock

1) we should make sure that a thread does not block infinitely if it is
unable to acquire a lock
- this is why using Lock interface’s tryLock() method is extremely convenient and useful

2) we should make sure that each thread acquires the locks in the same order
to avoid any cyclic dependency in lock acquisition

3) livelock can be handled with the methods above and some randomness
- threads retry acquiring the locks at random intervals
