Mutexes (mutual exclusion objects)

Mutual exclusion is a property of concurrency control which is instituted for the purpose of preventing race conditions

- process synchronization plays an important role in maintaining the consistency of shared data (critical section problem)
- mutex is very similar to a binary semaphore: while binary semaphore can be used as mutex, a mutex is a more specific use-case
- a Lock is designed to enforce a mutual exclusion concurrency control policy

Semaphores:
- it is a signalling mechanism
- threads and processes perform wait() and notify() operations to indicate whether they are acquiring or releasing the resource
- semaphore allows multiple program threads to access the finite instance of resources (not just a single resource)
- the process or thread blocks itself if no resource is free till the count of semaphore become greater than 0

Mutexes:
- mutex is a locking mechanism
- threads or processes have to acquire the lock on mutex object if it wants to acquire the resource
- mutex allows multiple program threads to access a single shared resource but one at a time
- if the lock is already acquired by another thread or process then the thread will wait until the mutex object gets unlocked
